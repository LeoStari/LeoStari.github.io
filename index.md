          I am an Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, to Chilean parents and moved to Chile at the age of three. I have a professional degree in Engineering from the University of Chile and worked as a project engineer for four years. In 2016, I came to Sendai, Japan, on a MEXT scholarship to pursue my Master's and PhD at Tohoku University.

          I enjoy living in Sendai, a city that I find to be the perfect size. In my free time, I like to play video games at home or go for walks with my Akita dog.

      My research focuses on the degradation of carbon tetrachloride by a novel Pseudomonas species. I am also involved in a group project on the "Identification of key community and metagenomic structures for soil microbial function."
